            <li>Add 2 cups of water, enough to submerge the meat. Wait for it to boil and then put the stove in low heat.</li>
            <li>Add 4 bay leaves and 1 Tbsp of black peppercorns.</li>

            <li>In the wok, add back about 1/4 cups (or less) of sauce. Let it boil.</li>
            <li>As soon as it boils, add back the pork and pan fry it. Gradually add back all the sauce as you pan fry.</li>
            <li>Once you add back all the sauce, you're done! Turn off the fire and serve the pork adobo with garlic rice and fried egg.</li>
