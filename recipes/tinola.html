        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tinola is a Filipino soup usually served as a main entr√©e with white rice. Traditionally, this dish is cooked with chicken, wedges of chayote, and leaves of the siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce.<br>
            I usually crave this dish the day after a night of drinking.</p>
